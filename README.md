# DEPRECATED VERSION
Please use the version at [JopStro/BalatroMods](https://github.com/JopStro/BalatroMods/) instead

# LibSprite for Balmod
Balmod api for injecting custom atlases into balatro.

An example mod that replaces the wee joker sprite with a unique one is also included in this repository in the mods folder.

# Installing
- Copy the apis folder from this repository to the balatro save directory (as detailed on balmod's github).
- Add a folder named "textures" next to the mods and apis folders and add two folders within it names 1x and 2x. These will be where any textures used by libsprite will go.

## Installing the Wee Joker mod
Just copy all the folders in this repository to the balatro save directory.

# Usage

> TODO write better documentation

# Features
- Injecting Asset Atlases
- Using Custom Atlases on Jokers, Consumables and Vouchers

## To Do
- Animation Atlases
- Standalone Images (Probably less needed as atlases fullfil this for most uses)
